                <h1>Hype Fragrance</h1>
                <p>Hype is a fragrance used by sports players,athletes and sports fans.
                   <br>
                   <br> 
                   The perfume encourages
                   sports players to challenge their limit without worrying about bad body odour and skin 
                   irritation.The fragrance can be afforded by middle income earner and sold at retail stores.
                <br>
                <br>
                  The motion graphic advertises different sports players challenging themselves and
                  showing their skills.The motion graphic shows how the logo
                  builds on screen using different 3d shapes apearing on screen from different directions
                  and rotations.
                <br>
                <br>
                  The background shows or suggests the 
                  possible result when used in different active spaces.At the end it shows a 3d 
                  design of Hype fragrance.
                <br>
                <br>
                 I used Black and Lime Greens to make the brand to look like a sports brand.
